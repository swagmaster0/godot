Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. Newer API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older versions.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.62 or newer | 4.14 or newer
1.61 | 4.12 to 4.13
1.60 | 4.6 to 4.11
1.59 | 4.6 to 4.8
1.58a or older | 4.5.4 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.

GodotSteam Version | Broken Compatibility
---|---
4.8 | Networking identity system removed, replaced with Steam IDs
4.9 | sendMessages returns an Array
4.11 | setLeaderboardDetailsMax removed
4.13 | getItemDefinitionProperty return a dictionary, html_needs_paint key 'bgra' changed to 'rbga'
4.14 | Removed first argument for stat request in steamInit and steamInitEx, steamInit returns intended bool value

Known Issues
---
- Steam overlay may not work when running your game from the editor if you are using Forward+ as the renderer unless you use auto-initialization from the Project Settings menu.  Your exported project should work perfectly fine in the Steam client, however.
- When self-compiling, **do not** use MinGW as it will cause crashes.
